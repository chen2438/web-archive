# The Bizarre Reality of Getting Online in North Korea

For 25 million North Koreans, the internet is an impossibility. Only a few thousand privileged members of the hermit kingdom’s society can access the global internet, while even the country’s heavily censored internal intranet is out of reach for the majority of the population. Getting access to free and open information isn’t an option.

New research from South Korea-based human rights organization People for Successful Corean Reunification (Pscore) details the reality for those who—in very limited circumstances—manage to get online in North Korea. The report reveals a days-long approval process to gain internet access, after which monitors sit next to people while they browse and approve their activities every five minutes. Even then, what can be accessed reveals little about the world outside North Korea’s borders.

Documentation from the NGO is being presented today at the human rights conference RightsCon and sheds light on the regime with the most limited internet freedoms, which fall far below the restrictive and surveilled internet access in China and Iran. For millions of people in North Korea, the internet simply doesn’t exist.

“I was taught about the World Wide Web, and even had to memorize it for an exam, but I only knew about the internet in theory,” one North Korean defector who left the country told Pscore researchers. “I knew it was a sort of network where you can search but didn’t actually know what it was.” Another said they didn’t “know the concept of Wi-Fi,” let alone have any clue about Google.

Getting an accurate picture of what happens within Kim Jong Un’s sealed-off state is incredibly challenging. Officials control all information flows and present state propaganda to the world. Analysts turn to those who escape and defect, at great personal risk, for a glimpse of North Korean reality. Pscore’s internet freedom report is based on 24 face-to-face interviews with defectors and a survey of 158 others. All left North Korea between 2012 and 2022.

The report says North Korean researcher Kim Suk-Han—all defector names within the research are pseudonyms for safety reasons—used the internet five times when they were living in the country. They had used the internet while on a trip to China and so had high expectations, they told the researchers. Instead, they faced limited access and constant surveillance.

“A librarian sits between two internet users and continuously monitors what people on both sides are searching up,” Kim said in testimony to the researchers. “Every five minutes, the screen freezes automatically, and the librarian must do a fingerprint authentication to allow further internet use.” A state security officer was also always nearby, they said.

People were allowed to use the internet for an hour, and if someone wanted more time, they would need to obtain new permission, Kim said. It took around two days to get permission from authorities to use the internet, a task requiring approvals from various officials. If someone applied too often, they would be made to wait, Kim said. “Every Korean website is blocked, and only Chinese or English websites are available.”

Over the past decade, there has been an increased number of digital devices in North Korea. Around 50 to 80 percent of adults may now have mobile phones, allowing them to text and call family members. Yet the use of these phones is highly controlled—data speeds are low, with devices capturing screenshots every few minutes and code that only allows government-approved content to be shown. And internet penetration is at nowhere near the same level.

“North Korean people cannot use it, not because of the infrastructure or not because of the country’s poor conditions,” says Nam Bada, the secretary general of Pscore and editor of the report. “It is only because of the governmental policy.”

A few dozen families with connections to Kim Jong-Un and some foreigners have unrestricted access to the global internet, while a “few thousand” people—including government officials, researchers, and students studying IT—can access a surveillance-heavy version of it, according to the report and previous research. North Koreans like Kim who are allowed some foreign travel, usually for business, can sometimes access the global web while abroad.

Mitch Haszard, a senior threat intelligence analyst at security firm Recorded Future, which has previously analyzed North Korean internet traffic, says Chinese and Russian internet service providers hook the country up to the global network, and access by foreign visitors makes up some of what can be seen externally. This may have changed during the Covid-19 pandemic when there were fewer foreigners in North Korea and its borders were closed.

According to multiple defectors quoted in the Pscore report, global internet access is only available in certain locations and buildings within North Korea. One person claimed internet connections at the National Academy of Sciences in Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital, were only available on the second floor, and just eight computers were connected. Around five people were granted use, they said.

Another defector told the Pscore researchers that when they got permission to travel to Pyongyang to use the internet, they tried to download medical research papers but could only access the titles of the papers and the author names. “I knew the concept of the global internet when I was in North Korea, but I didn’t know that so much information was exchanged through it,” said Shin Yong-Rok, another defector.

Martyn Williams is a senior fellow with the Stimson Center and 38 North project who has extensively studied technology in North Korea but was not involved with the report. Williams says the testimonies track with those of other defectors but add new details about the levels of surveillance people face. In general, Williams says, internet access “appears to be available for officially sanctioned uses, such as some universities, research establishments, and likely some trade organizations and other establishments.” University students Williams spoke to have previously said that they are required to state why they need to use the internet and are monitored when they get online.

Williams points to a 2020 North Korean law that has ramped up the country’s efforts to stop foreign information from being accessed in the country. In recent years, outside information—including TV shows and South Korean content—has been smuggled across the border using USB drives, giving people a glimpse of the outside world. “The new law levies harsh penalties, up to and including death, on people caught with foreign information,” Williams says. (In 2021 it was reported that a man who smuggled copies of the dystopian Netflix thriller Squid Game into North Korea and sold them was sentenced to death.)

While tightly controlled access to the internet is available for a few thousand “elites,” the local intranet is marginally more accessible—in theory, at least. Known as Kwangmyong, the intranet offers only a handful of websites. “Citizens can access [the intranet] from their phones or from computers,” Williams says. “Over the years, we’ve seen lots of websites shown and offered, and it appears that many major sectors of the government have their own sites with official information.” Some online shopping has recently become available, according to reports.

Defectors told Pscore that intranet prices were generally too high for most people, meaning a lot of access happens at official buildings, such as universities and libraries, where surveillance levels are high. People willing to take the risk can try to get around the system. “I’ve secretly played the game [Dota] twice through the intranet with people in another region,” said one defector, given the pseudonym Jung Woo-Jin. “I’ve only played three times. If you play more, your IP will be exposed by using more than a certain time, then your place will be recorded.” Most people included in the study said intranet use is impractical.

Pscore’s report lists around two dozen recommendations, addressed to both North Korea and international countries, for improving internet freedom. The report pushes for more connectivity within the country, advising North Korea to stop monitoring people and to connect the intranet to the global internet. If a full internet connection cannot be provided, a censored model like China’s would be a better last resort, the report says.

The report adds that countries should work to create a “legal framework” for international access and recognize internet access as a law-backed human right. Nam, the Pscore secretary general, says increasing internet access could benefit health care and education and improve people’s human rights, such as freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly.

Globally, 5.3 billion people regularly use the internet, or around 66 percent of Earth’s population. For years, official bodies have declared internet access to be a human right—with the United Nations saying there should be full connectivity by 2030. “The real problem is how to translate these commitments into reality,” says Barbora Bukovská, senior director of law and policy at human rights organization Article 19. “This includes issues such as making the internet affordable, getting people online, acquiring minimum digital skills and literacy, or achieving equality in access for marginalized groups and those at risk of discrimination.”

Bukovská says North Korea’s human rights record indicates that mandating internet access at a global level would likely not make much difference—bigger change within the country would be needed to implement such changes. But for those who have managed to leave the country, the difference is stark. “People will long for any new information, such as science and technology information,” defector Kim Suk-Han told researchers, “which are accessible through the internet.”

对于 2500 万朝鲜人来说，互联网是不可能的。 只有几千名隐士王国社会的特权成员可以访问全球互联网，而即使是该国受到严格审查的内部网络，大多数人也无法访问。 获取免费和开放的信息不是一种选择。

总部位于韩国的人权组织 People for Successful Corean Reunification (Pscore) 的最新研究详细说明了那些在非常有限的情况下设法在朝鲜上网的人的现实情况。 该报告揭示了为期数天的互联网访问审批流程，之后监控人员坐在人们旁边，他们每五分钟浏览一次并批准他们的活动。 即便如此，可以访问的内容也几乎无法揭示朝鲜境外的世界。

该非政府组织的文件今天在人权会议 RightsCon 上展示，揭示了互联网自由最有限的政权，这远远低于中国和伊朗的限制和监视互联网访问。 对于数百万朝鲜人来说，互联网根本不存在。

“我被教导了万维网，甚至为了考试不得不记住它，但我只知道理论上的互联网，”一位离开该国的朝鲜叛逃者告诉 Pscore 研究人员。 “我知道这是一种可以搜索的网络，但实际上并不知道它是什么。” 另一个人说他们“不知道 Wi-Fi 的概念”，更不用说对谷歌有任何了解了。

准确了解金正恩的封锁状态下发生的事情非常具有挑战性。 官员控制着所有信息流，并向全世界进行国家宣传。 分析人士转向那些冒着巨大个人风险逃跑和叛逃的人，以了解朝鲜的现实。 Pscore 的互联网自由报告基于对叛逃者的 24 次面对面采访和对其他 158 人的调查。 所有人都在 2012 年至 2022 年间离开了朝鲜。

报告称，朝鲜研究员 Kim Suk-Han（出于安全原因，研究中的所有叛逃者姓名均为化名）在该国居住期间使用了 5 次互联网。 他们告诉研究人员，他们在去中国旅行时使用过互联网，因此抱有很高的期望。 相反，他们面临有限的访问和持续的监视。

“一名图书管理员坐在两个互联网用户之间，不断监控双方的搜索内容，”金在向研究人员作证时说。 “每隔五分钟，屏幕就会自动冻结，图书管理员必须进行指纹验证才能继续使用互联网。” 他们说，一名国家安全官员也总是在附近。

金说，人们被允许使用互联网一个小时，如果有人想要更多时间，他们需要获得新的许可。 大约花了两天时间才获得当局许可使用互联网，这项任务需要得到多位官员的批准。 金说，如果有人申请得太频繁，他们就会被迫等待。 “所有韩国网站都被屏蔽了，只有中文或英文网站可以访问。”

在过去十年中，朝鲜的数字设备数量不断增加。 大约 50% 到 80% 的成年人现在可能拥有手机，可以让他们给家人发短信和打电话。 然而，这些手机的使用受到高度控制——数据速度很低，设备每隔几分钟捕获一次屏幕截图，并且代码只允许显示政府批准的内容。 互联网普及率远不及同一水平。

“朝鲜人民无法使用它，不是因为基础设施，也不是因为该国条件差，”Pscore 秘书长兼报告编辑 Nam Bada 说。 “这只是因为政府的政策。”

与金正恩有联系的几十个家庭和一些外国人可以不受限制地访问全球互联网，而“几千”人——包括政府官员、研究人员和学习 IT 的学生——可以访问监控密集的版本 ，根据报告和之前的研究。 像 Kim 这样被允许出国旅行（通常是出差）的朝鲜人有时可以在国外访问全球网络。

安全公司 Recorded Future 的高级威胁情报分析师 Mitch Haszard 曾分析过朝鲜的互联网流量，他说中国和俄罗斯的互联网服务提供商将朝鲜连接到全球网络，外国游客的访问构成了其中的一部分 被外界看到。 在 Covid-19 大流行期间，这种情况可能发生了变化，当时朝鲜的外国人较少并且边境关闭。

根据 Pscore 报告中引用的多名叛逃者的说法，全球互联网接入仅在朝鲜境内的某些地点和建筑物中可用。 一位人士称，位于朝鲜首都平壤的国家科学院只有二楼可以上网，而且只有八台电脑可以上网。 他们说，大约有五人获准使用。

另一名叛逃者告诉 Pscore 研究人员，当他们获准前往平壤使用互联网时，他们试图下载医学研究论文，但只能访问论文的标题和作者姓名。 “我在朝鲜时就知道全球互联网的概念，但我不知道通过它交换了这么多信息，”另一名叛逃者申永禄说。

马丁·威廉姆斯 (Martyn Williams) 是史汀生中心 (Stimson Center) 和 38 North 项目的高级研究员，他广泛研究了朝鲜的技术，但并未参与该报告。 威廉姆斯说，这些证词与其他叛逃者的证词一致，但增加了有关人们面临的监视程度的新细节。 威廉姆斯说，总的来说，互联网访问“似乎可用于官方认可的用途，例如一些大学、研究机构，可能还有一些贸易组织和其他机构。” 威廉姆斯采访过的大学生此前曾表示，他们必须说明为什么需要使用互联网，并在上网时受到监控。

威廉姆斯指出，2020 年的朝鲜法律加大了该国阻止外国信息在该国获取的力度。 近年来，包括电视节目和韩国内容在内的外部信息已通过 USB 驱动器走私出境，让人们得以一窥外面的世界。 威廉姆斯说：“新法律对被抓获外国信息的人处以严厉的处罚，最高可达死刑。” （据报道，2021 年一名男子将 Netflix 反乌托邦惊悚片《鱿鱼游戏》的副本走私到朝鲜并出售，因此被判处死刑。）

尽管几千名“精英”可以访问受到严格控制的互联网，但至少在理论上，本地内联网更容易访问。 被称为 Kwangmyong 的内部网仅提供少数几个网站。 “市民可以通过手机或电脑访问 [内联网]，”威廉姆斯说。 “多年来，我们看到很多网站被展示和提供，而且政府的许多主要部门似乎都有自己的官方网站。” 据报道，一些网上购物最近开始可用。

叛逃者告诉 Pscore，内联网价格对大多数人来说普遍太高，这意味着大量访问发生在官方建筑，如大学和图书馆，那里的监控水平很高。 愿意承担风险的人可以尝试绕过系统。 “我已经通过内联网和另一个地区的人秘密玩了两次 [Dota] 游戏，”一位化名郑宇振的叛逃者说。 “我只玩了三遍。 如果你玩多了，你的IP会因为使用超过一定时间而暴露，然后你的位置就会被记录下来。” 该研究中的大多数人都表示使用内联网是不切实际的。

Pscore 的报告列出了大约两打针对朝鲜和国际国家的改善互联网自由的建议。 该报告推动在国内建立更多连接，建议朝鲜停止监视人员并将内联网连接到全球互联网。 报告称，如果无法提供完整的互联网连接，像中国这样的审查模式将是更好的最后选择。

该报告补充说，各国应努力为国际访问创建一个“法律框架”，并将互联网访问视为一项受法律支持的人权。 Pscore 秘书长 Nam 表示，增加互联网接入可能有利于医疗保健和教育，并改善人们的人权，例如言论自由、结社自由和和平集会自由。

在全球范围内，有 53 亿人经常使用互联网，约占地球人口的 66%。 多年来，官方机构一直宣称互联网访问是一项人权——联合国表示到 2030 年应该实现全面连接。“真正的问题是如何将这些承诺变为现实，”法律高级主管 Barbora Bukovská 说 人权组织第 19 条的政策和政策。“这包括使互联网负担得起、让人们上网、获得最低限度的数字技能和识字，或实现边缘化群体和面临歧视风险的人的平等访问等问题。”

Bukovská 表示，朝鲜的人权记录表明，在全球范围内强制互联网访问可能不会产生太大影响——需要在国内进行更大的变革才能实施此类变革。 但对于那些设法离开这个国家的人来说，差别就很明显了。 “人们会渴望任何新信息，比如科技信息，”叛逃者金锡汉告诉研究人员，“这些信息可以通过互联网获取。”
